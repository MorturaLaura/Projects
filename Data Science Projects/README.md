# Data Science Projects
My aim in this folder is to do projects using machine learning algorithms and then grow to do projects using deep learning algorithms and natural language processing algorithms. I am starting with simpler projects and then I want to grow and slowly do projects with more complex algorithms. 
When creating these projescts I want to tackle problems that are in my circle of interests.

## Machine Learning Projects:
* [Rent price prediction Cluj Napoca](https://github.com/MorturaLaura/Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Rent%20price%20prediction%20Cluj%20Napoca);
* [Will we get a White Christmas in Transylvania in 2020?](https://github.com/MorturaLaura/Projects/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Projects/Will%20we%20get%20a%20White%20Christmas%20in%20Transylvania%20in%202020);
