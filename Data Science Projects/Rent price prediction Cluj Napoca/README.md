# Rent price prediction of apartments from Cluj Napoca

As my first Data Science project, I wanted to implement one that could help me practice the knowledge I accumulated in the past months regarding machine learning algorithms but also provide me the opportunity to learn how to create a simple web app. Also I wanted to do a project that could help me in some practical way. In my journey to become a data scientist and my process in getting my first job in the field in Cluj Napoca, when I am able to do so, the first thing I need to do is to find a rent. As a result I thought the proper project would be a 'Rent price prediction' one where you have to write the size of the apartment and select the number of rooms, number of the floor you like your apartment to be, the partitioning of the apartment, if it is in a new building or not and one of the most important things the neighborhood and then obtain the predicted price of the rent based upon these independent variables. 

To be able to implement this idea the first step was to obtain the data for processing and building my machine learning model. Therefore I needed to scrape the data from a website that has listed apartments for rent from Cluj Napoca and for that, I chose the website: [www.imobiliare.ro](https://www.imobiliare.ro/inchirieri-apartamente/cluj-napoca). I did the web scraping using Python, being my first web scraping project, what helped me was a [youtube tutorial for webscraping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A36TOm7NC8&t=4963s) provided by the channel [DR PI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtvGCaEzQZX7GwUJi-E3ALQ). Other tutorials that helped guide me through the process of building the machine learning model and the web app was the youtube tutorial [Real Estate Price Prediction Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdfbcdP75KI&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg). 

For the process of building my model, I used Python programming language and its specific libraries used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and building the machine learning model such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sklearn. For creating the server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests, I used Python Flask Server. For building the web app I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that will provide the user the ability to enter the desired square footage of the apartment and select other specific features such as the number of the floor, number of rooms, the partitioning of the apartment if the apartment-building is new or old and the neighborhood in which the apartment is located. After all, these characteristics of the desired apartment are established then the Python Flask Server will be called and it will retrieve the predicted price. 

In building the model what really made a difference and improved the score of the Linear Regression Model to 0.85 where the following aspects:

1. Removing the outliers that appear when the price per square footage of an apartment with more number rooms was less than the price per square footage of an apartment with less number of rooms that both are in the same neighborhood. This aspect was one of the most important lessons I received after doing the project because it showed me the importance of domain knowledge in managing and applying all steps previous to the one of building the machine learning model. 

2. Considering the independent features, the number of rooms and the number of the floor as discrete features and applying feature scaling didn't give me the expected score for my model, but when I considered them categorical features and applied One Hot Encoding that's when the score of my model grew and I was pleased with my result.
