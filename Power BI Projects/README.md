# Power BI Projects
After I followed a video of [Ken Jees youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KenJee1/featured), Reviewing Your Data Science Projects - Episode 18 [Job-Worthy GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHUD2T_VXfI&t=160s), I discovered the website [Workout Wednesdays](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/) that provides different exercises for you to work on your Tableau skills. Because I wanted first to learn how to work in Power BI, I thought why not do those exercises in Power BI instead of Tableau.
In this repository for every exercise or project in Power BI, I will provide a description of them and present my results.
