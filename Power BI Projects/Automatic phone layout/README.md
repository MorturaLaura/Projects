# Automatic phone layout

I tried solving the challenge from [2020 Week 21: Can you design for an automatic phone layout?](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/2020w21/) that also had a [dataset](https://data.world/annjackson/20194-tableau-superstore) needed for it to be solved.

The challenge was to create dashboards ready-made for mobile. 
So I made 2 mobile layouts, one for sales and one for profit. Each of them contained a table with the indicators year to date (YTD - the amount of sales/profit obtained in each year), year over year (YOY% - the percentage of growth or decrease in sales or profit compared to the results obtained in the previous year in sales or profit), year to date last year (YTD LY - the sales/profit obtained in the previous year) for the year 2018 and 2019.
They also contain a line chart with the evolution of sales or profit in 2018 and 2019.
The last thing presented for the mobile layout for sales was a bar chart that contained the first 10 customers from which the company obtained the most revenue. For the profit mobile layout, I presented the top 5 customers and the bottom 5 ones from which the company obtained profit.

The end result was:

## Profit app layout

## Sales app layout
